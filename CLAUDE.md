# Claude/Copilot Instructions

## Auto-Commit

After completing a task that modifies files, automatically commit all changes with a descriptive commit message:

```
git add -A && git commit -m "<descriptive message>"
```

The commit message should:
- Be concise but descriptive
- Summarize what was changed and why
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
